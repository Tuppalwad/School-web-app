            <p>
              A good playground will be large with many different surfaces
              (blacktop, grass, sand, etc.) to stimulate choice and leave
              options open. The playgrounds must be spacious and outdoors, but
              they must also be secluded so that the children (and their
              parents) feel safe and do not have to consider the outside world.

            <h2>Qualified teaching staff </h2>
            <p>
              The teachers who teach in those schools need to be qualified,
              experienced and passionate about teaching. The teacher must have a
              relevant 1st degree on the subject he or she is teaching. The
              percentage acquired by the teacher during his or her study life
              matters…a teacher who had been a good student during his/her study
              life can craft good students too. Furthermore, the experience of
              the teacher matters.
